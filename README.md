Deep Note:
One of the key aspects of learning programming is understanding that many concepts may seem repetitive or similar at first glance, but they have different nuances
and applications in different situations. This is especially true when it comes to object-oriented programming concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance,
and polymorphism. While these concepts may seem similar, they have different uses and implications when applied to software development.
	
One of the best ways to truly understand these concepts is to experiment with them. This means writing code, running it, and observing the results.
This allows you to see how the concepts work in practice and how they can be used to solve real-world problems. Additionally, examining existing projects and creating your own projects can provide a deeper understanding of how these concepts are used in industry and the trade-offs that come with using them.

It's also important to note that learning to program is an ongoing process and that you will continue to encounter new concepts and technologies throughout your career. The ability to learn quickly and adapt to new technologies is an essential skill for any programmer.

In summary, while studying concepts and understanding the theory is important, it's crucial to complement that with hands-on experimentation to truly grasp the concepts. This will help you to understand how to apply the concepts in different situations and make better decisions when designing and building software.
	
Remember that getting from point "X" to point "Y" takes a certain speed and time, and there is definitely energy and effort here.
Therefore, never give up on reaching the "Y" point where you set your target, it will be a great advantage for you to pre-determine every obstacle that comes your way.
Remember that rewards awaits you at "Y" point.
