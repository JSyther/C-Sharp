Generics: 

Generics in C# allow you to define a class or method that can work with any data type, without having to specify the data type at design time. This allows for a more
reusable and efficient code, as well as improved type safety.

Here is a step by step explanation of how to use generics in C#, including examples of generic classes, methods, and constraints:

Generic Classes: A generic class is a class that is defined with one or more type parameters, which are placeholders for the actual data types that the class will
work with. The type parameters are defined in angle brackets < > and are used throughtout the class defination. For example, here is simple generic class called
"MyList" that can work with a list of any data type:

class MyList<T>
