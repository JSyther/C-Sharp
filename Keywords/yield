In C#, the yield keyword is used in conjunction with iterator blocks to create a sequence of values that can be enumerated. 
An iterator block is a method that uses the yield keyword to return a sequence of values, one at a time, without needing to compute the entire sequence up front.

An example of an iterator block that returns a sequence of integers:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

public static IEnumerable<int> GetNumbers()
{
    yield return 1;
    yield return 2;
    yield return 3;
    yield return 4;
    yield return 5;
}

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This method returns an IEnumerable<int>, which is an interface that allows the caller to enumerate the sequence of integers returned by the method.
The yield keyword is used to return each integer in the sequence one at a time.
When the caller enumerates the sequence, the method is executed up to the point of the first yield statement, which returns the first integer in the sequence.
The method then waits for the caller to request the next integer, at which point it resumes execution and returns the next integer in the sequence.

The yield keyword can be used in a variety of ways to create different kinds of sequences.
For example, you can use the yield keyword in a loop to generate a sequence of numbers, or you can use it to create a sequence from an existing collection of objects.
You can also use the yield break statement to signal the end of the sequence and exit the method.


Here are the two yield statements in C#:

* yield return expression;
* yield break; 

The yield return statement is used inside an iterator method to return a value from the iterator and continue the iteration.
The yield break statement is used to end the iteration early and exit the iterator method.


"yield break" is a statement that is used in an iterator block to indicate that the sequence being generated is complete, and that no more values will be returned. 
When the yield break statement is executed, the method exits, and the sequence is considered to be fully enumerated.

An example that demonstrates the use of yield break:

------------------------------------------------------------------

public static IEnumerable<int> GetEvenNumbers(int maxNumber)
{
    for (int i = 0; i <= maxNumber; i++)
    {
        if (i % 2 == 0)
        {
            yield return i;
        }
    }

    yield break;
}

------------------------------------------------------------------

This method generates a sequence of even numbers from 0 up to a maximum number specified by the caller.
The for loop iterates over the range of numbers, and the if statement checks whether each number is even. If the number is even, 
it is returned using the yield return statement.

After the for loop completes, the yield break statement is used to signal that the sequence is complete and that no more values will be returned. 
If the yield break statement is omitted, the method would simply exit when the loop completes, and the sequence would not be considered fully enumerated.

An example of how to use the GetEvenNumbers method:
------------------------------------------------------------------
foreach (int number in GetEvenNumbers(10))
{
    Console.WriteLine(number);
}
------------------------------------------------------------------
This code would generate the following output:
------------------------------------------------------------------
0
2
4
6
8
10
------------------------------------------------------------------

It's important to note that iterator blocks are a powerful feature of C#, but they can also be somewhat complex to use correctly.
