A delegate is a type-safe function pointer that can hold a reference to a method. It allows you to pass method as an argument to another method, or to sore a method
in a variable.

Here's an example:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

class Program
{
    public delegate int MyDelegate(int x, int y);
    public static int Add(int x, int y)
    {
        return x + y;
    }
    public static int Multiply(int x, int y)
    {
        return x * y;
    }
    public static void Main()
    {
        MyDelegate d = Add;
        Console.WriteLine(d(5, 10));
        d = Multiply;
        Console.WriteLine(d(5, 10));
    }
}

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this example, the "MyDelegate" class is defined, it's a delegate that takes two integers as arguments and returns an integer. Then two methods "Add" and "Multiply"
are defined, they both take two integers as arguments and return an integer, and they both match the signature of the delegate.
In the main function, a variable "d" is declared and assigned to the Add method, so when the delegate is invoked, it will call the Add method. Then the delegate is invoked
with two integers as arguments and the output will be 15. then the delegate is assigned to the Multiply method, and when it's invoked with two integers as arguments, 
the output will be 50.

An event is a mechanism that allows a class to notify other classes when something of interest occurs. Events are typically used in situations where one class needs to
notify other classes when something happens, without those classes knowing the details of the class that generated the event. Here's an example:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

class Program
{
    public delegate void MyEventHandler();
    public event MyEventHandler MyEvent;
    public void RaiseEvent()
    {
        if (MyEvent != null)
            MyEvent();
    }
    public static void Main()
    {
        Program p = new Program();
        p.MyEvent += new MyEventHandler(p.OnMyEvent);
        p.RaiseEvent();
    }
    public void OnMyEvent()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Event raised.");
    }
}

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this example, the "Program" class defines an event "MyEvent" of type "MyEventHandler", which is a delegate, and it also defines a method "RaiseEvent()"
that raises the event. The Main function creates an instance of the program class and subscribe to the event "MyEvent", and it does that by adding a new instance
of the "MyEventHandler" delegate to the event. When the "RaiseEvent()" method is called, the "OnMyEvent()" method is executed, which writes "Event raised."
