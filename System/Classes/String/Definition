"System.String" is a class in the .NET Framework that represents a sequence of characters.
It is one of the most commonly used classes in the .NET Framework, as it is used to represent textual data in applications.

Here are some of the important properties, methods, and structures of the System.String class:

Properties

* Chars : Gets the character at the specified index position in the string.
* Length: Gets the number of characters in the string.

These two properties are the most commonly used properties of the System.String class. 
Chars allows you to access a specific character in the string by index, and Length gives you the total number of characters in the string.

Methods:

* Compare(strA, strB): Compares two strings and returns an integer indicating whether the first string is less than, equal to, or greater than the second string.
* Concat(str0, str1): Concatenates two or more strings into a single string.
* Contains(substring): Returns a boolean indicating whether the string contains the specified substring.
* IndexOf(substring): Returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified substring in the string.
* Insert(index, value): Inserts the specified string at the specified index position in the string.
* Replace(oldValue, newValue): Replaces all occurrences of the specified old value with the specified new value.
* Substring(startIndex, length): Returns a substring of the specified length starting at the specified index position in the string.
* ToLower(): Returns a new string in which all characters in the original string are converted to lowercase.
* ToUpper(): Returns a new string in which all characters in the original string are converted to uppercase.
* Trim(): Returns a new string with all leading and trailing white space characters removed.

Structures:

* StringBuilder: A mutable string class that allows for efficient string concatenation and modification.

Class:

* StringComparer: A class that provides methods for comparing strings using different comparison methods.

These are just a few examples of the properties, methods, and structures of the System.String class.
There are many more that you can explore and use in your .NET applications.
