The "System.Collections.Generic" namespace is also part of the .NET Framework and provides a collection of classes and interfaces
that implement various collection types similar to System.Collections, but with type safety.

A list of some of the classes, interfaces, and structures that are included in the System.Collections.Generic namespace:

* IEnumerable<T>  : Defines a method that enumerates the elements in a collection of type T.
* IEnumerator<T>  : Defines methods that allow you to iterate through a collection of type T.
* ICollection<T>  : Defines methods for adding, removing, and querying the elements of a collection of type T.
* IList<T>        : Defines methods for adding, removing, and accessing elements in a list of type T.
* List<T>         : Implements a dynamic array that can be resized as needed for elements of type T.
* Queue<T>        : Implements a first-in, first-out (FIFO) collection of objects of type T.
* Stack<T>        : Implements a last-in, first-out (LIFO) collection of objects of type T.

* IDictionary<TKey, TValue> : Defines methods for adding, removing, and accessing elements in a dictionary that uses keys of type TKey and values of type TValue.
* Dictionary<TKey, TValue>  : Implements a dictionary that uses keys of type TKey and values of type TValue.

These are some of the most commonly used classes and interfaces in the System.Collections.Generic namespace. 
The IEnumerable<T> and IEnumerator<T> interfaces are used to iterate through collections of type T using the foreach loop. 
The ICollection<T>, IList<T>, and IDictionary<TKey, TValue> interfaces provide methods for adding, removing,
and accessing elements in various collection types of type T.

The List<T> class is a dynamic array that can hold elements of type T, and can be resized as needed.
The Dictionary<TKey, TValue> class is a collection of key/value pairs where the keys and values are of type TKey and TValue, respectively. 
It is also type-safe.

The Queue<T> class is a collection of objects of type T that are inserted and removed in a first-in, first-out (FIFO) order. 
The Stack<T> class is a collection of objects of type T that are inserted and removed in a last-in, first-out (LIFO) order.

Other classes, interfaces, and structures in the System.Collections.Generic namespace include Comparer<T>, KeyValuePair<TKey, TValue>, LinkedList<T>, 
SortedList<TKey, TValue>, and ReadOnlyCollection<T>. These classes and interfaces provide additional collection types
and utility methods for working with collections of type T.

Overall, the System.Collections.Generic namespace provides type-safe alternatives to the non-generic collections in the System.Collections namespace,
which can help catch type-related errors at compile-time instead of run-time.
