"System.Serializable" is an attribute in C# that is used to indicate that a class or structure can be serialized. Serialization is the process of converting an object's
state to a format that can be stored or transmitted, and then restored later. The "System.Serializable" attribute allows the object to be serialized, which means
its state can be saved and restored later.

Here's an example of how "System.Serializable" can be used in a class:
---------------------------
[System.Serializable]
public class Data 
{
    public int score;
    public string name;
}
---------------------------

"Data" class can be serialized because it has the "System.Serializable" attribute. The "PlayerData" class contains two public variables, "score" and " name",
which will be serialized along with the object.

Serialization is often used in game developement to save game state, store data in a file, or transmit data over a network. The serialized data can be saved to a file,
which can be loaded later to restore the object's tate. In Unity, the "JsonUtility" class can be used to serialize and deserialize objects with the "System.Serializeable"
attribute.
