The #line directive is a preprocessor directive that allows you to change the current line number and/or the name of the current source file.
This can be useful in a variety of situations, such as when generating code programmatically, or when working with preprocessor macros that generate code.

A few examples of how to use the #line directive:


1. Changing the current line number:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#line 42
printf("This code is on line 42.\n");
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This code uses the #line directive to change the current line number to 42.
When the code is compiled and executed, the message "This code is on line 42." will be printed to the console.





2. Changing the current file name:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#line 1 "myheader.h"
#ifndef MY_HEADER_H
#define MY_HEADER_H

/* Header file contents go here */

#endif
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This code uses the #line directive to change the name of the current source file to "myheader.h".
When this header file is included in other source files, it will appear as if it were a file called "myheader.h" rather than the original name of the header file.
This can be useful for providing more descriptive names for generated code or for controlling how source files are organized.



3. Generating code programmatically:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#define MY_MACRO() \
    #line 1 "generated.h" \
    int generated_func() { return 42; } \
    #line __LINE__ \
    MY_MACRO()

MY_MACRO();
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This code defines a preprocessor macro called MY_MACRO() that generates code programmatically. 
The #line directive is used to change the current file name to "generated.h" and the current line number to 1, and then a function definition is generated.
The #line directive is then used again to set the line number to the current line number (which will be the line number of the MY_MACRO() definition),
and then the macro is called recursively to generate more code.

In summary, the #line preprocessor directive is a powerful tool for changing the current line number and/or file name, which can be useful
in a variety of situations such as generating code programmatically or controlling how source files are organized.
It provides a lot of flexibility and can help to make code more modular and easier to maintain.
